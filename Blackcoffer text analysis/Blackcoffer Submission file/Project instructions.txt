Project instructions

Overview:
This project involves extracting textual data from a list of URLs, performing text analysis, 
and computing various variables based on the specified output structure. The computed results 
are saved in an Excel file in the same order as the output structure file.

Approach:
Data Collection:

URLs are provided in an Excel file (Input.xlsx).
Python script uses web scraping (BeautifulSoup) to extract article text from each URL.

Text Analysis:

Text analysis is performed on the extracted article text.
Sentiment analysis is conducted using the TextBlob library.
Additional metrics such as average sentence length, percentage of complex words, and Fog Index
are computed.

Dependencies:

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed such as beautiful soup, nltk, pandas.

How to Run:

Save the URLs in an Excel file named Input.xlsx with columns 'URL_ID' and 'URL'.
Run the Python script (script.py) to perform the data extraction and analysis:
bash

python script.py
The results will be saved in an Excel file named Output.xlsx.
Output Structure:

The output file (Output.xlsx) contains the computed variables in the exact order specified in the 
output structure file.
